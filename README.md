# Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs: Variable Naming with Graph Neural Networks

This repo applies the model of Allamanis et al. ([Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJOFETxR-) from ICLR '18) to the Variable Naming task on the [Python150k Dataset](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150) published by ETH Zurich.  

This repo is a fork of [microsoft/graph-based-code-modelling](https://github.com/microsoft/graph-based-code-modelling), which has the source code for a different paper by the authors.  However, the repo contained all the pieces necessary to reproduce the model: a pipeline to tensorize program graphs, generate node embeddings using a CharCNN, perform message passing with a GGNN (`ContextGraphModel`), and output variable names using a GRU Decoder (`SeqDecoder`).  With the generous assistance of Marc Brockschmidt (@mmjb), we refactored the codebase to perform Variable Naming instead of code generation and run on a Python dataset.

## Model

### Program Graphs
Because Python is dynamically rather than statically typed and interpreted rather than compiled, we are unable to create many of the semantic edges used in program graphs.  While some semantic edges could be derived, we decided to **use Syntax edges only** (`Child` edges from the raw AST and and `NextToken` edges connecting consecutive terminal AST nodes).

### VarNaming Task
We formulate the VarNaming task slightly differently than Allamanis et al.  In particular, in "Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs," the authors create their input graph by masking *all* instances of a specific variable name in the AST using a special `<SLOT>` token.  The model then genetates the variable name based on the combined contexts of its usages by averaging the output representation of each `<SLOT>` as the input to the decoder.  This program graph is richer than what we use:
- From every AST we sample 10 snippets *S*, which are defined as having between 10 and 64 nodes and usually span 2-5 lines
- Within each snippet, we randomly choose a variable and mask it with the special `<SLOT>` token.  We then predict the variable name (also a sequence-generation task) based on the output representation of this single instance.  Note that some predictions, in particular class attributes or global variables, are not actually known to be in the scope of the code at this specific location from the snippet.

In particular, we consider the following nodes as "variables":
- Arguments (`Name` class, `ctx = Param` nodes in the Python2.7 AST)
- Variable declatations (`Name` class, `ctx = Store`)
- Attributes (`Attribute` class)

Concretely, in the piece of code below, the variables would be `epsilon` (attribute of the keras backend), `y_true` (as a parameter), `y_pred` (as a parameter), and `kl_div` (when it's created).  However, the later mentions of all 3 (e.g. in `y_true = K.clip(y_true, K.epsilon, 1)` or `return kl_div`) after they are instantiated or defined would be `Name` nodes with `ctx = Store` and thus not considered as variables for our task.

```python
def kullback_leibler_divergence(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = K.clip(y_true, K.epsilon, 1)
    y_pred = K.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon, 1)
    kl_div = K.sum(y_true * K.log(y_true / y_pred), axis=-1)
    return kl_div
```

Allamanis et al. also embed terminal nodes by averaging a learned embedding for each subtoken, split by underscores/camelCase depending on the programming language convention (i.e. *E("pascal_case") = 0.5 E("pascal") + 0.5 E("case")*).  Using the authors suggestion, we instead embed nodes using a Character-Level CNN (see [Zhang et al, 2015](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf) for background on CharCNNs).  They found in subsequent experiments that this improved their performance.

## Results

On a python150k test set, we achieve the following accuracies on a randomly sampled subset of the test dataset (described below):

```
Accuracy@1: 34.5671%
Accuracy@3: 42.4864%
Accuracy@5: 45.6902%
```

This is similar to the original authors' accuracy @1 using only Syntax edges on their C# dataset (34.3%).

Sample predictions are available in `py150v2.test_log`.  We also include the training log in `py150v2.train_log` and the pretrained model in `py150v2_py150v2_model_best.pkl.gz`

## Steps for Reproduction

1) Download and unzip the python150k dataset and python150k source files from ETH Zurich (into the root of this repository):

```
wget http://files.srl.inf.ethz.ch/data/py150.tar.gz
tar xvzf py150.tar.gz
cd py150
wget http://files.srl.inf.ethz.ch/data/py150_files.tar.gz
tar xvzf py150_files.tar.gz
mv py150_files py150_src_files ## Apologies for unnecessarily renaming the folder
```

2) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
virtualenv .env #(make sure it uses Python3.5+)
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r Models/requirements.txt
```

3) Convert the dataset from the format that the python150k graphs are provided in to the format used by the MSR model.  We use the same input graph format as the one used in the [VarMisuse dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56844) released by MSR (which results in some clunky syntax because we need to store less information than they did).  This will create a folder called `py150_parsed` that contains `eval` and `test` subfolders with 10 JSON-ized and randomly masked snippets for every AST in the original dataset.

```
python convert_dataset.py -g ./py150/python50k_eval.json -f ./py150/py150_src_files/python50k_eval.txt -s py150_parsed
python convert_dataset.py -g ./py150/python100k_train.json -f ./py150/py150_src_files/python100k_train.txt -s py150_parsed --snippets_per_file=10000
```

4) Randomly split `python50k_eval` into dev and test sets by executing the following command in the Python shell.  By default, the `dev_test_split` function sets a random seed of 0 and splits the dataset 75%/25% dev/test.

```python
from convert_dataset import dev_test_split
dev_test_split('py150_parsed/python50k_eval')
```

5) Tensorize the data.  This uses the JSON representation of the program graphs to compute vocabularies, the
grammar required to produce the observed expressions, and then transforms node labels from string form into tensorised form, etc.

```
python Models/utils/tensorise.py --hypers-override '{"excluded_cg_edge_types": ["LastLexicalUse", "LastUse", "LastWrite", "GuardedBy", "GuardedByNegation", "FormalArgName", "ComputedFrom", "ReturnsTo"],  "cg_node_type_embedding_size" : 0, "cg_add_subtoken_nodes" : false, "cg_ggnn_residual_connections" : {}}' --debug --model graph2seq py150_tensorized ./graph-dataset/polly/polly-typehierarchy.json.gz ./py150_parsed/python100k_train ./py150_parsed/python50k_eval/dev
```

Note that the third argument (`./graph-dataset/polly/polly-typehierarchy.json.gz` is an arbitrary placeholder to stop the program from crashing and not used at - this is the "type hierarchy" file that allows the model to incorporate variable type information.  We disable it for Python, because type information is unavailable).  The script might fail to detect the json-ized files because it expects `.json.gz` zip files.  If so, zip the files and continue:

```
gzip -r py150_parsed/python100k_train
gzip -r py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test
gzip -r py150_parsed/python50k_eval/dev
```

6) Train the model!

```
python Models/utils/train.py --model graph2seq --hypers-override '{"excluded_cg_edge_types": ["LastLexicalUse", "LastUse", "LastWrite", "GuardedBy", "GuardedByNegation", "FormalArgName", "ComputedFrom", "ReturnsTo"],  "cg_node_type_embedding_size" : 0, "cg_add_subtoken_nodes" : false, "cg_ggnn_residual_connections" : {}}' --run-name py150v2 Models/trained_models py150_tensorized/python100k_train py150_tensorized/dev
```

Our model converged after 260 epochs with the default hyperparameter settings.  Note that we exclude all of the Semantic edges from the program graphs and disable node type embeddings with the override parameter `"cg_node_type_embedding_size" : 0`.

7) Test the model!

```
python Models/utils/test.py --num-processes 8 py150v2_py150v2_model_best.pkl.gz py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test Models/trained_models/py150v2
```

Because of some quirk in the way the `SequenceDecoder` model works (see my conversation with the authors [here](https://github.com/microsoft/graph-based-code-modelling/issues/2#issuecomment-492977056)), testing the model can take a really long time.  We sampled a random test set of 150 files from `py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test` using the following code (which creates a new directory, `py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test_small`).  We then ran the test script above but replaced the argument `py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test` with `py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test_small`

```python
import os                                                                                                                     
import random
import shutil                                                                                                               
dir = 'py150_parsed/python50k_eval/test'                                                                                      
files = os.listdir(dir)                                                                                                      
random.seed(0)                                                                                                                
new_files = random.sample(files, 150)                                                                                         
os.mkdir(dir + '_small')                                                                                                      
for file in new_files: 
    shutil.copyfile(dir + '/' + file, dir + '_small/' + file)
```

## Dataset Preparation

### Python150k Dataset Format
The Python150k dataset contains graphs in the following format (see [sample_py150_graph.json](https://github.com/haighal/graph-based-code-modelling/blob/master/sample_py150_graph.json))

- `python100k_train.txt` contains the names of files and their corresponding GitHub repos
- `python100k_train.json` contains the ASTs of the parsed files.  Each line is a json file, and each graph is a list of (0-indexed) nodes, each represented as an object with several name/value pairs:
    - (Required) `type`: string containing type of current AST node
    - (Optional) `value`: string containing value (if any) of the current AST node
    - (Optional) `children`: array of integers denoting indices of children (if any) of the current AST node. Indices are 0-based starting from the first node in the JSON file

### MSR Dataset Format
We convert it to the format of the dataset released by MSR [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56844).  Each file is a json object that is a list of graphs, and each graph has the following fields (see [sample_msr_graph.json](https://github.com/haighal/graph-based-code-modelling/blob/master/sample_msr_graph.json):
- `ContextGraph` - the main graph object
    - `Edges`
        - `Child` - a list of `[src, dst]` node IDs, which correspond to the edges of the original AST
        - `NextToken` - a list of `[src, dst]` node IDs, which correspond to consecutive terminal nodes in the original AST
    - `NodeLabels` - a dict from node ID (as a string) to name (either the node type or the name of the variable).  Per Allamanis et al., "We label syntax nodes with the name of the nonterminal from the program's grammar, whereas syntax tokens are labeled with the string that they represent"
    - `NodeTypes` - this usually holds the variable type, but we just set it to be an empty dictionary (which is then ignored) because we don't have that information in Python
- `SlotDummyNode` - int corresponding to the node ID of the `<SLOT>` token in the vocabulary
- `SymbolCandidates` - list of dicts containing `{"IsCorrect": true, "SymbolDummyNode": 1, "SymbolName": "parameter"}` for the correct variable name
- `filename` - code file that the AST came from
- `slotTokenIdx` - index of the token in the source file that is described by this problem instance.  We set it to be blank because it's mostly used for debugging and didn't want to go back into the source files to link them.

### Pipeline Overview

We convert the python150k dataset to the MSR format using `convert_dataset.py`.  The snippets for each graph are created by the function `create_varnaming_samples` if you want to use it on a one-off basis.  At a high level, the code does the following to each AST:
- Converts the AST to a Python NetworkX graph (with node attribute information)
- Generates (up to) 10 non-overlapping snippets from the AST, defined as subgraphs of the AST with between 10 and 64 nodes.  We generate these by DFS from nodes starting at the root and traversing down the tree until we arrive at a subgraph of the right size
- Chooses a random variable (as defined in the VarNaming section above) to mask and masks it
- Converts the NetworkX graph for the snippet to ContextGraph

This is the same traversal strategy used in [codegraph-fmt](https://github.com/dtsbourg/codegraph-fmt) and in a preprint paper (the `generate_snippets` function is identical).

## Modifications to the Original Repo

The base of the model used in *Learning to Represent Code with Graphs* already existed in the [original Graph-Based Code Modelling Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/graph-based-code-modelling) via the Graph2SeqModel (`models/exprsynth/graph2seqmodel`, found [here](https://github.com/haighal/graph-based-code-modelling/blob/master/models/exprsynth/graph22eqmodel)).  This uses the `ContextGraphModel` introduced in *Learning to Represent Code with Graphs* to encode the graph: it embeds nodes based on their string representation and variable type information using a CharCNN then performs message passing with a Graph Gated Neural Network (GGNN) to generate an output representation for every node.  The sequence decoder then finds the output representation of the the `<SLOT>` token and uses that as the input to a GRU decoder that predicts a target string as a sequence of subtokens (e.g., the name `input_stream_buffer` is treated as the sequence `[input, stream, buffer]`).  This graph2seq architecture is trained using a maximum likelihood objective.

Our modifications were thus primarily to the infrastructure of the codebase to rewire the data pipeline.  We initially started working with a C# dataset released by Allamanis et al., so we modified the pipeline to handle graphs of this strucutre (although it would have been easier to directly convert the Python150k graphs to the original schema).

Our conversation with the authors is documented in an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/graph-based-code-modelling/issues/2) in the original graph-based-code-modelling repo

#### List of Modifications
- Our graphs don't have edge values or weights.  We removed the reference to `raw_sample['ContextGraph']['EdgeValues']` in  `"Models/exprsynth/contextgraphmodel.py", line 287, in _load_metadata_from_sample`
- We're generating a string rather than completing the program graph.  We thus don't have the field `raw_sample['SymbolLabels']` and remove calls to it.  To generate the ground truth sequence, we:
    - Use `dpu_utils.codeutils.split_identifier_into_parts` to split variable names into subtokens in `load_metadata_from_sample` and then use the resulting tokens to update the `decoder_token_counter`
    - We do the same thing in `load_data_from_sample` instead of calling `collect_token_seq` (and just remove `collect_token_seq` and calls to `raw_sample["Productions"]`)
    - These are both implemented in the method `extract_tokens_from_sample` in `Models/exprsynth/utils.py`
- We change every instance of the string `"<HOLE>"` to `"<SLOT>"`, `"HoleNode"` to `"SlotDummyNode"`, and `"HoleLineSpan"` to `"SlotDummyNode"` (just a product of the different schema)
- Removed a couple calls to fields that didn't exist in our schema that were unnecessary for the task (e.g. `loaded_train_sample['Provenance'] = raw_sample['Filename'] + "::" + raw_sample['HoleLineSpan']` and `write_snippet(sample_idx, build_csharp_check_function(raw_sample, ' '.join(predictions[0][0])))` in `Models/utils/test.py`
- Removed `is_train` argument on `SeqDecoder.finalise_minibatch()` since it isn't used and was causing crashes
- To ignore variable type innformation:
    - In the `hypers_override` argument of the calls to tensorize/train/test, we set `'cg_node_type_embedding_size = 0`
    - We then guarded references to the  `TypeLattice` in lines 249 in `Models/exprsynth/model.py` and 344 and 399 in `Models/exprsynth/contextgraphmodel.py` with `if hyperparameters['cg_node_type_embedding_size'] > 0:`
    
# (Original README) Generative Code Modeling with Graphs

This is the code required to reproduce experiments in two of our papers on
modeling of programs, composed of three major components:
* A C# program required to extract (simplified) program graphs from C#
  source files, similar to our ICLR'18 paper
  [Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJOFETxR-).
  More precisely, it implements that paper apart from the speculative 
  dataflow component ("draw dataflow edges as if a variable would be used 
  in this place") and the alias analysis to filter equivalent variables.
* A TensorFlow model for program graphs, following ICLR'18 paper
  [Learning to Represent Programs with Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJOFETxR-).
  This is a refactoring/partial rewrite of the original model, incorporating
  some new ideas on the representation of node labels from Cvitkovic et al.
  ([Open Vocabulary Learning on Source Code with a Graph-Structured Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08305)).
* A TensorFlow model to generate new source code expressions conditional
  on their context, implementing our ICLR'19 paper
  [Generative Code Modeling with Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bke4KsA5FX).

# Running the Code
The released code provides two components:
* Data Extraction: A C# project extracting graphs and expressions from a corpus
  of C# projects. The sources for this are in `DataExtraction/`.
* Modelling: A Python project learning model of expressions, conditionally on
  the program context. The sources for this are in `Models/`.

Note that the code is a research prototype; the documentation is generally
incomplete and code quality is varying.

## Data Extraction
### Building the data extractor
To build the data extraction, you need a .NET development environment (i.e.,
a working `dotnet` executable). Once this is set up, you can build the 
extractor as follows:
```
DataExtraction$ dotnet build
[...]
    ExpressionDataExtractor -> ExpressionDataExtractor\bin\Debug\net472\ExpressionDataExtractor.exe

Build succeeded.
[...]
```

### Using the data extractor
You can then use the resulting binary to extract contexts and expressions from
a C# project:
```
DataExtraction$ ExpressionDataExtractor/bin/Debug/net472/ExpressionDataExtractor.exe TestProject outputs/{graphs,types}
Writing graphs at outputs/graphs
Writing type hierarchies at outputs/types
[11/01/2019 14:07:05] Starting building all solutions in TestProject
[11/01/2019 14:07:05] Restoring packages for: TestProject/TinyTest.sln
[11/01/2019 14:07:05] In dir TestProject running nuget restore TinyTest.sln -NonInteractive -source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json

Opening output file outputs/graphs/exprs-graph.0.jsonl.gz.
[11/01/2019 14:07:09] Extracted 15 expressions from TestProject/Program.cs.
```
Now, `outputs/graphs/exprs-graph.0.jsonl.gz` will contain (15) samples
consisting of a context graph and a target expression in tree form.
`ExpressionDataExtractor.exe --help` provides some information on
additional options.

*Note*: Building C# projects is often non-trivial (requiring [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)
and other libraries in the
path, preparing the build by running helper scripts, etc.). Roughly, data
extraction from a solution `Project.sln` will only succeed if running 
`MSBuild Project.sln` succeeds as well.

### Extractor Structure
Data extraction is split into two projects:
* `ExpressionDataExtractor`: This is the actual command-line utility with
  some code to find and build C# projects in a directory tree.
* `SourceGraphExtractionUtils`: This project contains the actual extraction
  logic. Almost all of the interesting logic is in `GraphDataExtractor`, which
  is in dire need of a refactoring. This class does four complex things:
    - Identify target expressions to extract (`SimpleExpressionIdentifier`).
    - Turn expressions into a simplified version of the C# syntax tree
      (`TurnIntoProductions`). This is needed because Roslyn does not expose an
      /abstract/ syntax tree, but a /full/ ST with all surface code artifacts.
    - Construction of a Program Graph as in "Learning to Represent Programs
      with Graphs", ICLR'18 (`ExtractSourceGraph`).
    - Extraction of a subgraph of limited size around a target expression,
      removing the target expression in the process (`CopySubgraphAroundHole`).
  
  There is some bare-bones documentation for these components, but if you
  are trying to understand them and are stuck, open an issue with concrete
  questions and better documentation will magically appear.

## Models
First, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the needed
dependencies. Note that all code is written in Python 3.

As the preprocessing of graphs into tensorised form is relatively computationally expensive,
we use a preprocessing step to do this. This computes vocabularies, the
grammar required to produce the observed expressions and so on, and then
transforms node labels from string form into tensorised form, etc.:
```
$ utils/tensorise.py test_data/tensorised test_data/exprs-types.json.gz test_data/graphs/
Imputed grammar:
  Expression  -[00]->  ! Expression
  Expression  -[01]->  - Expression
  Expression  -[02]->  -- Expression
  Expression  -[03]->  CharLiteral
  Expression  -[04]->  Expression * Expression
  Expression  -[05]->  Expression + Expression
  Expression  -[06]->  Expression ++
  Expression  -[07]->  Expression . IndexOf ( Expression )
  Expression  -[08]->  Expression . IndexOf ( Expression , Expression , Expression )
  Expression  -[09]->  Expression . StartsWith ( Expression )
  Expression  -[10]->  Expression < Expression
  Expression  -[11]->  Expression > Expression
  Expression  -[12]->  Expression ? Expression : Expression
  Expression  -[13]->  Expression [ Expression ]
  Expression  -[14]->  IntLiteral
  Expression  -[15]->  StringLiteral
  Expression  -[16]->  Variable
Known literals:
  IntLiteral: ['%UNK%', '0', '1', '2', '4', '43']
  CharLiteral: ['%UNK%', "'-'"]
  StringLiteral: ['"foobar"', '%UNK%']
Tensorised 15 (15 before filtering) samples from 'test_data/graphs/' into 'test_data/tensorised/'.
```

If you want to use a given vocabulary/grammar (e.g., to prepare validation
data), you can use the computed metadata from another folder:
```
$ utils/tensorise.py --metadata-to-use test_data/tensorised/metadata.pkl.gz test_data/tensorised_valid test_data/exprs-types.json.gz test_data/graphs/
Tensorised 15 (15 before filtering) samples from 'test_data/graphs/' into 'test_data/tensorised_valid/'.
```

### Training
To test if everything works, training on a small number of examples
should work:
```

### Model Variations
There are four different model types implemented:
 * `NAG`: The main model presented in "Generative Code Modeling with Graphs" 
   (ICLR'19), representing the program context by a graph and using the
   graph-structured decoding strategy discussed in the paper.
 * `seq2graph`: An ablation that uses the graph-structured decoder, but
   represents the context using a sequence model. Concretely, a window
   of tokens around the hole to fill is fed into a two-layer BiGRU to
   obtain a representation for the program context.
   Additionally, for each variable in scope, a number of token windows
   around usages are encoded with a second BiGRU, and their
   representation is averaged.
* `graph2seq`: An ablation that uses a graph to represent the program context,
  but then relies on a 2-layer GRU to construct the target expression.
* `seq2seq`: An ablation using both a sequence encoder for the program context
  as well as a sequence decoder.
  
All models have a wide range of different hyperparameters.
As these choices influence the format of tensorised data, both `tensorise.py`
and `train.py` need to be re-run for every variation:
```
$ utils/tensorise.py test_data/tensorised_seq2graph test_data/exprs-types.json.gz test_data/graphs/ --model seq2graph --hypers-override '{"eg_hidden_size": 32, "cx_token_representation_size": 64}'
[...]
$ utils/train.py test_data/tensorised_seq2graph/{,} --model seq2graph --hypers-override '{"eg_hidden_size": 32, "cx_token_representation_size": 64}'
[...]
```

### Model Structure

Roughly, the model code is split into three main components:
* Infrastructure: The `Model` class (in `exprsynth/model.py`) implements the
  usual general infrastructure bits; and models are expected to implement
  certain hooks in it. All of these are documented individually.
  - Saving and loading models, hyperparameters, training loop, etc.
  - Construction of metadata such as vocabularies: This code is parallelised
    and implementations need to extend three core methods (`_init_metadata`,
    `_load_metadata_from_sample`, `_finalise_metadata`) to use this code.
    Intuitively, `init_metadata` prepares a `dict` to store raw information
    (e.g., token counters) and `_load_metadata_from_sample` processes a 
    single datapoint to update this raw data. These two are usually
    parallelised, and `_finalise_metadata` has to combine all raw metadata
    dictionaries to obtain one metadata dictionary, containing for example
    a vocabulary (in a MapReduce style).
  - Tensorising raw samples: `_load_data_from_sample` needs to be extended
    for this, and implementors can use the computed metadata.
  - Minibatch construction: We build minibatches by growing a batch until
    we reach a size limit (e.g., because we hit the maximal number of nodes
    per batch). This is implemented in the methods `_init_minibatch`
    (creating a new dictionary to hold data), `_extend_minibatch_by_sample`
    to add a new sample to a batch, and `_finalise_minibatch`, which can do
    final flattening operations and turn things into a feed dict.
    
    *Note* 1: This somewhat complicated strategy is required for two
    reasons. First, the sizes of graphs can vary substantially, and so
    picking a fixed number of graphs may yield a minibatch that is very
    small or large (in number of nodes). At the same time, our strategy
    of treating graph batches as one large graph requires regular shifting
    of node indices of samples, which is easiest to implement correctly
    in this incremental fashion.

    *Note* 2: In principle, these methods should be executed on another
    thread, so that a new minibatch can be constructed while the GPU is
    computing. Code for this exists, but was taken out for simplicity here.
 * Context Models: Two context models are implemented:
   - `ContextGraphModel` (in `exprsynth/contegraphmodel.py`): This is
     the code implementing the modeling of a program graph, taking types,
     labels, dataflow, etc. into account. It produces a representation of
     all nodes in the input graphs as `model.ops['cg_node_representations']`,
     which can then be used in downstream models.
   - `ContextTokenModel` (in `exprsynth/contexttokenmodel.py`): This implements
     a simple BiGRU model over the tokens around the target expression, taking
     types into account. It produces a representation of all tokens in these
     contexts as `model.ops['cx_hole_context_representations']`.
 * Decoder Models: Two decoder models are implemented:
   - `NAGDecoder` (in `exprsynth/nagdecoder.py`): This is the code implementing
     the modeling of program generation as a graph.

     First, a representation of all nodes in the expansion graph is computed
     using scheduled message passing (implemented using `AsyncGGNN` at training
     time and step-wise use of `get_node_attributes` at test time).
     The schedule is determined by the `__load_expansiongraph_training_data_from_sample`
     method (and is the core of our paper).

     Second, a number of expansion decisions are made. The modeling of grammar
     productions is in `__make_production_choice_logits_model`, variables are
     chosen in `__make_variable_choice_logits_model` and literals are produced
     or copied in `__make_literal_choice_logits_model`.
   - `SeqDecoder` (in `exprsynth/seqdecoder.py`): A simple sequence decoder.
 * Glue code: Context models and decoders are combined using the actual models
   we instantiate. For example, `NAGModel` extends the `ContextGraphModel` and
   instantiates a `NAGDecoder`, contributing only some functionality to forward
   data from the encoder to the decoder.
